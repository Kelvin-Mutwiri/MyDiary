Hubs
When you connect multiple computers on a network, they all plug into a central device called a hub. The hub has the job of moving the network signal from one wire to another. In the case of a basic hub, the signal from one computer is sent to all other computers on the hub, and each NIC decides whether to pass the information to the computer or just drop it if it is not the intended recipient.
Switches
Switches are really smart hubs in that they are able to build tables that keep up with which computer is on which switch port. With this intelligence, a switch does not transmit all information to all other computers on the switch, just to the destination computer. Switching technology helps to reduce congestion on a network and should be used for networks of 10 or more computers.
